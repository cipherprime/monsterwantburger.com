# About Monster Want Burger!
At its core, Monster Want Burger is an extremely cute game where you make burgers for a hungry monster. We’ve added a lot of cool little features, including a custom burger naming algorithm. But probably the most important thing is how many “firsts” we had with this game. Monster Want Burger is:

- Our first self-published iPhone game!
- Our first game aimed towards kids!
- Our first game with a character!
- The first time we made all our assets inside of Unity3D (using some cool new tools we’ve been working on)
- The first time we’ve released a game made for a Dev Night Game Jam
- The first time we self-published a desktop game as pay-what-you-want through our own distribution method
- And last but not least, Cipher Prime’s first released mini-game! 

Thanks for being here for so many first time events. Go grab Monster Want Burger now!
